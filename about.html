               <h2> About Kneaded Touch Massage</h2>
               <p> Jim French is the massage therapist here at Kneaded Touch Massage. He has over 20 years of experience in the art of massage therapy.
                   He is a licensed and insured massage therapist that has recently established a new office here in Mount Plesant, Iowa.</p>
               <p>Jim was born and raised in Iowa but made a career in New Mexico. Since receiving his massage license in New Mexico,
                   he has performed over 15,000 massages. He has recently moved back to Iowa from New Mexico in 2022 and wants to continue doing what he enjoys most. 
                   He has a passion for massage therapy that is fueled by helping others achieve peace, tranquality, and a better life.</p>
               <p>After decades of massage therapy, Jim has developed his own philosophy known as "The Five P's". This philosophy represents 
                  <span class = "bolden">Purpose</span>, <span class = "bolden">Passion</span>, <span class = "bolden"> Presence</span>, <span class = "bolden">Pace</span>, and <span class = "bolden">Pressure</span>. 
                  These core values are not just words to him; they are truths he faithfully follows in his work. 
                  Purpose drives his dedicated approach; Passion fuels his commitment to each client’s well-being; Presence ensures mindful and attentive care; 
                  Pace reflects his understanding of the body’s need for time to heal; and Pressure is skillfully applied for maximum therapeutic benefit. 
                  Together, these principles shape every healing touch and therapeutic session he provides, offering a truly holistic and transformative experience.</p>
